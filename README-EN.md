## Presentation

This project was created in my spare time using the network and network service skills I have acquired.

The goal of this project was to repurpose an old machine destined to collect dust and configure it as a personal server.

I first installed Debian on the machine, then removed the graphical interface and connected it to my network.

<br>

## Features

Then, I configured the following features:

+ Multimedia server with Plex configuration (containerization, port forwarding, and automatic startup).
+ Remote access either directly to the machine with SSH or to the containers with Yacht.
+ File storage across two hard drives.

<br>

## Areas for Improvement

As this project is constantly evolving, here are some improvement ideas I plan to implement:

+ Automatic file synchronization with my main machine.
+ Web server to host and test my projects.
+ RAID/mirroring to back up my files.
+ GitLab to store and manage my projects.
+ Personal cloud with Nextcloud to store my files.
+ VPN with OpenVPN to secure my connections.
+ Application to manage my connected lights.
